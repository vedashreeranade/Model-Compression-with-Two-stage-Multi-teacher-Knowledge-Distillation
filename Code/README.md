## .ipynb files details
1. Project_mnli.ipynb - contains all the initial experimentation on student model, 1-o-1 and m-o-m experimentation on MNLI dataset 
2. Project_snli.ipynb - 1-o-1 and m-o-m experimentation on SNLI dataset 
3. Project_qnli.ipynb - 1-o-1 and m-o-m experimentation on QNLI dataset

5. Project_m_o_1.ipynb - m-o-1 implementation on RTE dataset and then finetuning on QNLI dataset 

## checkpoints
- Create a folder named checkpoints and create multiple folders inside this folder to store the checkpoints accordingly. Refer the folder path in the code to know the folder names.
- For m-o-1 model:
    - Stage 1 student model trained on RTE dataset : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VKA25BDx-d14U8mpHQRtunwjea1CaQ2/view?usp=sharing
    - Stage 2 finetuned student model on QNLI dataset : https://drive.google.com/file/d/107W-lc7bavkw2ARbhuZyqpk00MkQJiDj/view?usp=sharing
